# Solidity and Yul: Low-Level Assembly

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring low-level operations in Solidity using Yul, an intermediate language designed for Ethereum smart contract development. The examples provided here aim to demonstrate the capabilities, optimizations, and complexities of working directly with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) through Yul.

**Disclaimer**: The code examples are primarily for educational purposes. They illustrate advanced concepts in smart contract development that require a comprehensive understanding of the EVM, Solidity, and smart contract security.

## What is Yul?

Yul is an intermediate language and a compiler target for Solidity. It enables developers to write highly efficient code that operates at a lower level than Solidity's high-level syntax. Yul code can be compiled into bytecode for the EVM and eWASM (Ethereum-flavored WebAssembly), making it a versatile tool for smart contract optimization and complex logic implementation.

## Understanding Low-Level Coding

Low-level coding in the context of smart contracts involves direct interaction with the underlying workings of the EVM. This approach allows for:

- Fine-tuning and gas optimization.
- Access to features not directly exposed in Solidity.
- In-depth control and customization of contract behavior.

However, it requires a deep understanding of blockchain concepts, EVM internals, and diligent attention to security concerns.

## Repository Content

This repository contains various Solidity contracts that demonstrate the use of Yul for different purposes, such as:

- Arithmetic and logical operations.
- Advanced state manipulation.
- Inline assembly examples.
- Gas optimization techniques.
- Error handling and security considerations.

Each contract is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to facilitate understanding and learning.

## Getting Started

To explore and test the examples:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary tools like [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or use an online IDE like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
3. Compile and deploy contracts as needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denizumutdereli/solidity-yul-assembly
cd solidity-yul-assembly
npm install
npm install --save-dev hardhat hardhat-ethers hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle ethers
npx hardhat init
npx hardhat compile
aderyn .
```

For further Aderyn AST analysis

```bash
aderyn .
```

For further Foundry AST analysis and REPL

```bash
forge build
chisel
```
